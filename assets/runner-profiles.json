In 2015, Wilson achieved what no Irish woman had ever done — she won the legendary Ben Nevis Mountain Race, conquering the 1,344-meter ascent and treacherous descent in 2:41:00. Two years later, she returned to claim the title again with a stunning 2:01:21, her name etched permanently on Scottish mountain running's most prestigious trophy. Teammates described her as 'fearless on the downhill,' a reputation earned through countless victories in NIMRA and Hill & Dale series races. Wilson's Lough 5 silver was her on the roads; Ben Nevis was her in the mountains — and she conquered both."

Moran's personal bests tell the story of a complete middle-distance runner: 3:43 for 1500m, 3:58 for the mile, and 8:03 for 3000m. Competing internationally for Ireland, Moran represents the modern track athlete who can translate speed into road racing success. His single Lough 5 appearance captured an athlete operating at national level, bringing the finishing speed of a sub-4 minute equivalent miler to a 5-mile road race. Like other track specialists who've excelled at Lough 5, Moran's performance demonstrated that pure speed combined with endurance makes for a formidable road racing combination."

The Run for Enda athlete first appeared in 2021 at age 65, winning the F65 category with 57:13. She returned in 2022 to defend her F65 title with a significantly improved 51:01, then achieved her breakthrough in 2025 as an F70 competitor: 48:37 for the age record and her third consecutive category gold. Moohan's improvement trajectory — dropping from 57:13 to 48:37 across three races — demonstrates that masters athletes can continue to develop speed and endurance well into their seventies. Her consistent category dominance and sustained year-on-year improvement make her one of the most impressive female masters performers in recent Lough 5 history."
