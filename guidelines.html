            We want everyone to enjoy the day and get home safely. Please review these guidelines before race day.
        </p>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>1. Runners</h3>
            <p>
                By entering the Lough 5 you agree to follow these simple guidelines:
            </p>

            <h4>Before race day</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be fit to run.</strong> Only take part if you're in good health and have trained appropriately. If in doubt, chat to your GP first.</li>
                <li><strong>Know the basics.</strong> It's a 5-mile road race with a final loop around the lough path. There are hills and, as it's winter, surfaces may be wet or slippery.</li>
                <li><strong>Bring suitable kit.</strong> Dress for cold, changeable weather and bring warm, dry clothing for afterwards.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>On the day</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Don't race if you feel unwell.</strong> Cold, flu, chest infection, stomach bug, fever or chest pain? Please don't run. There's always next year.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical info.</strong> If you have a medical condition, jot key details and an emergency contact on the back of your race number.</li>
                <li><strong>Listen to instructions.</strong> Follow signs, stewards and any announcements. They're there to keep you safe.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>On the start line</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Line up honestly.</strong> Faster runners to the front, steady/fun runners further back – it makes the start smoother and safer for everyone.</li>
                <li><strong>Headphones.</strong> We strongly discourage the use of headphones or ear buds. You need to be able to hear stewards, other runners and any emergency vehicles.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Out on the course</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Follow the route.</strong> Stick to the marked course and stay within cones/barriers where used.</li>
                <li><strong>Overtake with care.</strong> Especially on the lough path and narrower sections – give other runners space and be patient.</li>
                <li><strong>Water & The Lough.</strong> The Lough is deep and cold. Do not enter the water at any time and stay on the path.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>If you need to stop</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Slow down safely.</strong> Step to the side so you don't block others.</li>
                <li><strong>Tell someone.</strong> Let the nearest marshal know if you're dropping out. They'll inform race control and medical.</li>
                <li><strong>If someone else is in trouble.</strong> Stop, help if you can do so safely, and alert the nearest marshal or runner to get help.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>2. Kids' Race</h3>
            <p>
                The kids' race is all about fun, participation and confidence – not just winning. Safety is our top priority.
            </p>

            <h4>For parents/guardians</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adult presence required.</strong> A parent/guardian must be present at the event for every child taking part.</li>
                <li><strong>Check they're well.</strong> Please don't let your child run if they're unwell or recovering from illness.</li>
                <li><strong>Suitable clothing.</strong> Make sure they're dressed for cold, possibly wet weather and have dry clothes for afterwards.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>During the race</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Follow the stewards.</strong> Children should follow the marked route and listen to stewards at all times.</li>
                <li><strong>No pushing or rough play.</strong> It's a fun run – we'll encourage good sportsmanship and respect for others.</li>
                <li><strong>Water and The Lough.</strong> Children must stay on the path and away from the water's edge.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>3. Spectator & Supporter</h3>
            <p>
                Supporters make the atmosphere – thank you for coming along!
            </p>

            <h4>Getting there and parking</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Arrive in good time.</strong> New Year's Eve can be busy; please plan to arrive early.</li>
                <li><strong>Use the car parks.</strong> Follow signs and stewards to the GAA pitch, chapel and village car parks. Please avoid parking on the race route or blocking driveways.</li>
                <li><strong>Drive slowly.</strong> Look out for pedestrians and follow steward directions at all times.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Watching the race</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep the route clear.</strong> Avoid standing in the road or on the running line, especially near corners and the finish area.</li>
                <li><strong>Children & dogs.</strong> Keep children close by and supervised. Dogs must be on leads and kept away from the runners' path.</li>
                <li><strong>Near the lough.</strong> Please keep back from the water's edge and don't allow children to play near the bank.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>During emergencies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Follow instructions.</strong> If stewards ask you to move or make space, please do so quickly and calmly.</li>
                <li><strong>Give space to medical teams.</strong> If medical staff or emergency vehicles are attending to someone, give them plenty of room.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>4. Traffic & Parking</h3>
            <p>
                Because the race uses local roads, we need everyone's help to keep things running smoothly.
            </p>

            <h4>Road closures</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Closed for a short period.</strong> Key sections of the course will be closed to traffic during the race. Diversions will be signposted.</li>
                <li><strong>Emergency access maintained.</strong> Blue-light vehicles will always be allowed through. If this happens, stewards may briefly stop runners.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>For residents and visitors</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Plan ahead.</strong> If you need to drive during the race period, please allow extra time and follow diversion signs.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect closures.</strong> We ask all road users to support this community event.</li>
                <li><strong>Be patient.</strong> Delays should be short and we'll reopen roads as soon as the last runner is safely through.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>5. Health, Medical & Personal Responsibility</h3>
            <p>
                We work with qualified medical providers to look after runners, but everyone still has a part to play.
            </p>

            <h4>Your health</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Know your limits.</strong> Only run if you feel well and have done some training.</li>
                <li><strong>Stop if needed.</strong> If you develop chest pain, severe shortness of breath, dizziness or feel very unwell, slow down and seek help immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Tell us about conditions.</strong> Write any important medical info and an emergency contact on the back of your number.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Medical support</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>On-site medical team.</strong> Trained first-aiders and ambulance staff will be based at the start/finish and available on the course.</li>
                <li><strong>How to get help.</strong> Tell the nearest marshal or runner if you or someone else needs assistance – they will contact race control and medical.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>6. Weather & Cancellation</h3>
            <p>
                It's December – we expect "a bit of everything".
            </p>

            <h4>Before the event</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Check the forecast.</strong> Dress accordingly and assume it will feel colder than you expect once you stop running.</li>
                <li><strong>Footwear.</strong> Consider shoes with decent grip for wet or frosty surfaces, especially on The Lough path.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Decisions on the day</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Safety comes first.</strong> In the event of ice, flooding, severe wind or other dangerous conditions, the organisers may shorten, delay or cancel the race.</li>
                <li><strong>Communication.</strong> Any major changes will be announced on our website and social media, and on the PA at race HQ.</li>
                <li><strong>No pressure.</strong> If conditions feel too risky for you personally, you're free to sit this one out – we'd rather see you back fit next year.</li>
            </ul>
